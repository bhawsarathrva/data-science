    "Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "Ans. **Wrapper Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evaluates subsets of features using a predictive model.\n",
    "* Iteratively adds or removes features to the subset until an optimal combination is found.\n",
    "* Costly and computationally intensive, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "* Provides high-quality, customized feature sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Filter Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evaluates individual features based on statistical tests or information theory measures.\n",
    "* Ranks features and selects those with high scores, without considering the interactions with other        features.\n",
    "* Less costly and faster than wrapper methods.\n",
    "* May result in suboptimal feature sets that do not account for interdependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Invocation:** Wrapper methods use a predictive model to evaluate subsets of features, while filter methods evaluate individual features.\n",
    "* **Complexity:** Wrapper methods are more computationally intensive due to iterative feature selection.\n",
    "* **Quality:** Wrapper methods generally produce higher quality feature sets, while filter methods are easier to apply and less expensive.\n",
    "* **Feature Interactions:** Wrapper methods consider feature interactions, while filter methods do not.\n",
    "* **Suitability:** Wrapper methods are often used for smaller datasets where cost is less of a concern, while filter methods are more suitable for larger datasets and when computational efficiency is critical.\n"

    "Ans. **Filter Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chi-square Test:** Assesses the independence between the feature and the output variable. Higher chi-square values indicate stronger association.\n",
    "* **Information Gain:** Measures the reduction in uncertainty about the output variable when the feature is known. Higher information gain means better discrimination.\n",
    "* **Mutual Information:** Quantifies the dependency between the feature and the output variable. Higher mutual information indicates stronger correlation.\n",
    "* **Pearson Correlation:** Calculates the linear relationship between the feature and the output variable. High correlation values suggest feature importance.\n",
    "* **Wrapper Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Forward Selection:** Iteratively adds the most significant feature to the selected set until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "* **Backward Selection:** Iteratively removes the least significant feature from the selected set until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "* **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):** Sequential forward selection with a recursive elimination step to remove redundant features.\n",
    "* **Hybrid Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Embedded Regularization:** Adds regularization terms to the learning algorithm that penalize model complexity, promoting the selection of informative features.\n",
    "* **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC):** A penalized likelihood function that balances model complexity with feature importance.\n",
    "* **Information Theoretic Feature Selection:** Uses information theory concepts to identify features that maximize the information content while minimizing redundancy."
