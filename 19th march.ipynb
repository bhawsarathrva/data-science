    "Ans. A data preparation method called min-max scaling is used to change characteristics in a dataset to a range, usually between 0 and 1. Normalisation is another name for this method. Each data point's minimum value of a characteristic is subtracted, and the result is divided by the range.\n",

    "Q2. What is the Unit Vector technique in feature scaling, and how does it differ from Min-Max scaling? \n",
    "Provide an example to illustrate its application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Unit Vector Technique in Feature Scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, the Unit Vector technique—also referred to as Normalization—is a feature scaling approach that sets the values of numerical data to a common scale. The Unit Vector approach scales features to a magnitude of 1, in contrast to Min-Max scaling, which scales features to a specified range (e.g., between 0 and 1). This indicates that every feature vector is converted into a unit vector, which has a length of 1 and points in the same direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's How it Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the magnitude of each feature vector: The magnitude (or length) of a vector is calculated using the Euclidean norm (square root of the sum of squared elements).\n",
    "2. Divide each component of the feature vector by its magnitude: This scales the vector down to a unit length while preserving its direction and relative information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference from Min-Max Scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Range: Unit Vector scaling results in features with a magnitude of 1, while Min-Max scaling scales features to a specific range.\n",
    "* Outliers: Unit Vector scaling is less sensitive to outliers than Min-Max scaling, as it focuses on the direction rather than the absolute values.\n",
    "* Interpretation: In Min-Max scaling, the resulting values are easy to interpret as they fall within a defined range. Unit Vector scaling retains the relative information between features but interpretation of individual values might be less intuitive.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans. PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a commonly used method for dimensionality reduction. It is a powerhouse for dimensionality reduction. To put it another way, it's a technique for converting a high-dimensional (many feature) dataset into a lower-dimensional one while keeping the most crucial data. The greatest variance in the data is captured by developing new, uncorrelated variables known as principle components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How PCA works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data standardization:**  The data is first standardized to ensure all features have zero mean and unit variance. This prevents features with larger scales from dominating the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Covariance matrix computation:**  A covariance matrix is calculated to understand the relationships between different features. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Eigenvectors and eigenvalues:**  Eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are computed. Eigenvectors represent the directions of the principal components, and eigenvalues signify the magnitude of variance explained by each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Selecting principal components:**  The eigenvectors are sorted based on their corresponding eigenvalues in descending order. The top eigenvectors, explaining the most variance, are selected as the principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data transformation:** The original data is projected onto the lower-dimensional space defined by the chosen principal components, resulting in a reduced dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of using PCA:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reduced computational cost:**  By working with fewer dimensions, algorithms can run faster and require less memory.\n",
    "* **Improved visualization:**  High-dimensional data is often difficult to visualize. PCA can project the data onto 2D or 3D space, making it easier to understand patterns and relationships. \n",
    "* **Noise reduction:**  PCA can filter out noise and redundancy in the data by focusing on the components that explain the most variance.\n",
    "* **Feature extraction:**  The principal components can be used as new features for machine learning models, potentially leading to better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Image compression**\n",

    "Imagine you have a dataset of images, each represented by thousands of pixels. Using PCA, you can reduce the dimensionality of this data by identifying the principal components that capture the most important variations in the images. These principal components could represent features like edges, textures, and shapes. By keeping only these essential components, you can reconstruct compressed versions of the original images with minimal loss of information. This technique is commonly used in image and video compression algorithms. \n"

    "3.  **Replace original values:** Replace the original values in the dataset with the scaled values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Benefits of Min-Max Scaling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Improves Model Performance:** By putting all features on the same scale, we ensure that no single feature dominates the model's learning process. This can lead to more accurate and efficient recommendations.\n",
