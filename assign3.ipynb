    "3. Which Python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans. The try and except block in python is used to catch and handle exceptions.\n",

    "\n",
    "b. finally\n",
    "\n",
    "c. raise\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. (a). Try and Except are used for error handling. The try block contains the code that may raise an exception while the except block contains the code that handles the exception.\n",

    "ex. try:\n",
    "    num1 = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    num2 = int(input(\"Enter another number: \"))\n",

    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "(b). Finally is a block of code that is executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. This block is commonly used to perform clean-up actions such as closing files, releasing resources, or cleaning up database connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "ex. try:\n",
    "    file = open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",

    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"File not found!\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "(c). Raise is a keyword that is used to raise an exception. This can be useful when you want to indicate    that something unexpected or exceptional has happened in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "ex. def calculate_area(width, height):\n",
    "    if width <= 0 or height <= 0:\n",

    "5. What are Custom Exceptions in python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exceptions that are created by deriving from the built-in  Exception class or one of its subclasses. These exceptions can be used to indicate specific errors or exceptional situations in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need custom exceptions in Python for several reasons. First, they allow us to provide more specific and informative error messages to the user. Second, they help us to handle errors in a more organized and consistent way, making our code more robust and easier to maintain. Finally, they enable us to encapsulate error handling logic in a separate module or\n",
