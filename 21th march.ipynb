    "Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?\n",
    "Ans. Data encoding is the process of converting data from one format to another, usually from a textual format to a binary format that computers can process. \n",
    "This is important in data science because it allows computers to process, store, and transmit information that is not numerical-based, such as text, audio, and video. Data encoding enables us to communicate information digitally and use it effectively. It is also essential for data analysis, as it allows us to transform raw data into a format that algorithms can read and interpret."
