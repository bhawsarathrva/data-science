    "### Q1. Explain the difference between linear regression and logistic regression models. Provide an example of a scenario where logistic regression would be more appropriate.\n",
    "**Linear Regression** is used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the output.  \n",
    "**Logistic Regression**, on the other hand, is used to predict a binary or categorical target variable. It outputs probabilities using the logistic function and maps the predicted values to classes using a threshold.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Predicting whether an email is spam (1) or not spam (0) is a scenario where logistic regression would be more appropriate.\n"

    "### Q2. What is the cost function used in logistic regression, and how is it optimized?\n",
    "The cost function used in logistic regression is the **log-loss** or **cross-entropy loss**. It measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function is optimized using **gradient descent** or its variants (e.g., stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent) to find the parameter values that minimize the cost function.\n"

    "**Regularization** is a technique used to add a penalty term to the cost function to reduce overfitting by discouraging complex models.  \n",
    "- **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**: Adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. It can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, performing feature selection.\n",
    "- **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**: Adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. It results in smaller coefficients but does not shrink them to zero.\n",

    "Regularization helps in simplifying the model and reducing variance.\n"

    "### Q4. What is the ROC curve, and how is it used to evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model?\n",
    "The **ROC curve** (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) is a graphical representation of a classifierâ€™s performance across different threshold values. It plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR).  \n",
    "The **AUC (Area Under the Curve)** is used as a summary metric; a higher AUC indicates better model performance.\n"

    "- **Regularization**: L1 regularization can directly help in feature selection.\n",
    "- **Statistical tests**: Using tests like Chi-square or mutual information.\n",
    "- **Feature importance**: Using algorithms like Random Forest to gauge feature importance.\n",

    "- **Class weighting**: Assigning higher weights to the minority class in the cost function.\n",
    "- **Evaluation metrics**: Using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC instead of accuracy.\n",

    "- **Multicollinearity**: This can be addressed by removing one of the correlated features, using PCA (Principal Component Analysis), or applying regularization (especially L2).\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: Use regularization techniques (L1/L2) or reduce model complexity.\n",
    "- **Imbalanced data**: Use class weighting, resampling techniques, or appropriate evaluation metrics.\n",
    "- **Feature scaling**: Standardize features for better convergence during optimization.\n"
