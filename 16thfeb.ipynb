    "1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Ans. A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and organized in a way that allows for    efficient retrieval and manipulation of information.Data is organized into tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each row represents a single record, while each column represents an attribute or field of the record\n",

    "     2. Relational database management system.\n",
    "     3. Vertically scalable.\n",
    "     4. Fixed or predefined schemas.\n",
    "     5. Not suitable for heirarchical data storage. \n",

    "Ans. Primary Key: It is a unique identifier for each record in a table, which is used to ensure that each record can be identified and accessed quickly and efficiently. A primary key can be a single column or a combination of columns, and it must be unique and non-null for each record in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key: It is a column or set of columns in one table that references the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.It ensures that data in one table is related to data in another table, and it can be used to enforce referential integrity, which ensures that data in related tables remains consistent."
