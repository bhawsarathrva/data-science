    "Ans. Class: A class is a user defined layout or blue print of an object that describe what a specific kind of object will look like. A class descriptive consist of two things:\n",
    "1. Attribute or member variable\n",
    "2. Implementatoon of behavior or member function\n",

    "Ans.  init is a special python method that runs whenever a new object is created. These types of functions are used to initialize the attributes of that class, E.g., if the class is Person, then the attributes will be name, age, etc."

    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "Ans. The self variable is used to represent the instance of the class which is often used in object-oriented programming. It works as a reference to the object. Python uses the self parameter to refer to instance attributes and methods of the class."

    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "Ans. Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class. Hence, inheritance facilitates Reusability and is an important concept of OOPs.\n",
