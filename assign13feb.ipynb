    "1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "Ans. When creating a custom exception, it is recommended to derive from the built-in Exception class or one of its subclasses. This is because the Exception class provides a set of standard methods and attributes that are used to handle exceptions in Python. By deriving from Exception, you inherit these methods and attributes, which makes it easier to work with your custom exceptions.\n",
