    "Sample size: Suitable for small sample sizes (typically less than 30) when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "Distribution: Uses the t-distribution, which has heavier tails than the normal (z) distribution, accounting for uncertainty introduced by estimating the population standard deviation from a small sample.\n",
    "Example: You want to compare the average heights of two different groups of people. You collect data on the heights of 100 people in Group A and 100 people in Group B. You conduct a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference between the average heights of the two groups.\n",

    "Ans. Bayes' theorem is a method of calculating conditional probabilities. It allows us to update our beliefs in light of new evidence.\n",

    "To understand Bayes' theorem, it is helpful to first understand the concept of conditional probability. Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. For example, the probability of it raining tomorrow given that there is a 30% chance of rain is 0.3.\n",

    "   - A confidence interval (CI) is a range of values estimated to contain the true value of a population parameter with a certain level of confidence.\n",
    "   - This range is calculated from sample data and is used to make inferences about the population parameter.\n",

    "     - **Sample Standard Deviation ($s$)**: A measure of the variability of the sample data.\n",

    "\n",
    "**3. Formula for Confidence Interval**:\n",

    "     - **Lower Boundary**: $\\bar{x} - Z \\times (s/\\sqrt{n})$\n",

    "Ans. 1. **Margin of Error (MOE):** \n",
    "   - The margin of error in a confidence interval is the maximum amount by which the sample statistic (e.g., sample mean) may differ from the true population parameter (e.g., population mean) with a specified level of confidence. \n",
    "   - It represents the precision of the estimate, with a smaller margin of error indicating a more precise estimate. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Effect of Sample Size on Margin of Error:** \n",
    "   - The sample size plays a crucial role in determining the margin of error. Generally, as the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases. \n",
    "   - This is because a larger sample provides more data points, which leads to a more accurate representation of the population. \n",

    "   - Doubling the sample size reduces the margin of error by approximately 41%. \n",

    "6. Make a decision:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the calculated t-statistic (0) falls within the critical t-values (±1.699), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is not enough evidence to conclude that the caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at a 90% confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the results of the hypothesis test, we cannot say that caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time in this sample of participants at a 90% confidence level. However, it is important to note that this conclusion is based on a specific sample and different results may be obtained with a different sample."
