    "1. What is the fundamental idea behind the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework?\n",
    "Ans. The fundamental idea behind YOLO (You Only Look Once) is to perform object detection in a single pass through a neural network. Unlike traditional methods that use region proposals or multiple stages, YOLO divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes, class probabilities, and confidence scores simultaneously. This makes YOLO fast and efficient, enabling real-time object detection by treating detection as a unified regression problem."

    "ANs. The key difference between YOLO V1 and traditional sliding window approaches for object detection lies in their methodology and efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sliding Window Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Process: Traditional methods use a sliding window that moves across the image at different scales and locations, applying a classifier to each window to detect objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawbacks: This approach is computationally expensive because it requires evaluating a large number of windows, many of which may not contain objects. It also involves redundant calculations and is slower due to the need for multiple passes over the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLO V1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Process: YOLO (You Only Look Once) divides the image into a fixed grid (e.g., 7x7). Each grid cell predicts a fixed number of bounding boxes, confidence scores for those boxes, and class probabilities. These predictions are made in a single forward pass through the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed: YOLO is significantly faster because it processes the entire image in one go, eliminating the need for multiple passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unified Detection: It treats object detection as a regression problem, predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities directly, which simplifies the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context Awareness: By predicting bounding boxes and classes for the entire image simultaneously, YOLO can leverage global context, reducing false positives compared to sliding window methods."

    "Grid Division: The image is divided into an S×S grid (e.g., 7x7).\n",

    "\n",
    "Dimensions: (width, height) relative to the entire image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Score: Indicates how confident the model is that the box contains an object and how accurate the box is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Probabilities: Each grid cell also predicts C class probabilities, representing the likelihood that an object in the cell belongs to each class, regardless of the number of bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output combines these predictions: for each grid cell, there are B×(5 + C) values, where 5 represents the 4 bounding box coordinates plus the confidence score, and C represents the class probabilities.
