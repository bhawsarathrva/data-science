    "How do activation functions affect the training process and performance of a neural network?\n",
    "Ans. Activation functions play a crucial role in both the training process and the performance of neural networks. Let’s break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 1. Introducing Non-linearity\n",
    "Without activation functions, a neural network is just a series of linear transformations — no matter how many layers you add, the output will always be linear.\n",
    "Non-linearity allows the network to learn complex patterns, such as recognizing shapes in images or relationships in data.\n",
    "✅ Impact: Enables the network to solve non-linear problems like image recognition, language processing, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚡ 2. Gradient Flow & Training Stability\n",
    "Activation functions affect how gradients flow during backpropagation:\n",
    "ReLU: Prevents vanishing gradients by keeping gradients large for positive inputs.\n",
    "Sigmoid/Tanh: Can cause vanishing gradient problems — small gradients slow down learning in deeper layers.\n",
    "✅ Impact: Poor activation choices can cause gradients to either explode or vanish, leading to slow or unstable training.\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 3. Convergence Speed\n",
    "ReLU and Leaky ReLU train faster since they don’t saturate (except for negative values in ReLU).\n",
    "Sigmoid and Tanh slow training due to their saturation — small gradient changes when inputs are very high or low.\n",
    "✅ Impact: Faster activation functions mean quicker convergence during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "🏆 4. Output Interpretability\n",
    "Softmax gives probabilities for multi-class classification, making outputs interpretable.\n",
    "Sigmoid is perfect for binary classification — outputs range between 0 and 1, representing probabilities.\n",
    "✅ Impact: Ensures output values make sense for tasks like classification or regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "📏 5. Preventing Dead Neurons\n",
