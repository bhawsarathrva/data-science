    "MEAN: The mean, also known as the average, is calculated by adding up all the values in a dataset and then dividing by the total number of values. It is sensitive to extreme values, also known as outliers, as they can significantly impact the calculated mean.\n",

    "When the data is somewhat regularly distributed and there are no extreme outliers, the mean is typically utilised. However, if the data contains outliers, it may not adequately represent the core tendency.\n",

    "MEDIAN: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an odd number of values, the median is the middle value itself. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by outliers compared to the mean, making it a more robust measure of central tendency.\n",
    "\n",
    "MODE:The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have no mode (if all values are unique) or multiple modes (if more than one value occurs with the highest frequency). The mode is useful for identifying the most common value in a dataset and is often used with categorical or discrete data."
